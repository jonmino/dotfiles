# Dotfiles
My personal dotfiles based on the amazing work of other people.

# Prerequisites
You need git to be able to clone the repository to `~/dotfiles`.
You should also already have a patched font installed and applied to your terminal.
.wezterm.lua makes use of FiraCode Nerd Font from https://www.nerdfonts.com/
with (MesloLGS NF)[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k] as Fallback.
and (SourceCodePro)[https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts/blob/patching-strategy/patched/SourceCodePro%2BPowerline%2BAwesome%2BRegular.ttf] as a further fallback.
